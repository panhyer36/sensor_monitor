CO₂ concentration is within moderate range, but it's recommended to regularly ventilate.
CO₂ concentration is in a good range, indicating adequate air circulation.
Particle matter, PM2.5 average is
PM10 average is
Air quality is very unhealthy, suggesting reducing outdoor activities and using an air purifier indoors.
Air quality is unhealthy, sensitive groups should avoid outdoor activities.
Air quality is moderate, sensitive groups should pay attention to protection.
Particle matter content is low, air quality is good.
Temperature and Humidity Environment
Today's average indoor temperature is
reaching a high of
Overall temperature is very hot, which may affect comfort, health and work efficiency severely.
Temperature is hot, which may affect comfort and work efficiency.
Indoor temperature is cold, please pay attention to heating.
Temperature is maintained in a comfortable range, which is beneficial for work and rest.
Humidity, average humidity is
Humidity is very high, which may lead to mold growth and affect health, it's recommended to use dehumidifier.
Humidity is high, consider using a dehumidifier to improve comfort.
Air is too dry, which may cause skin discomfort and respiratory issues, it's recommended to add humidity appropriately.
Humidity is maintained at a comfortable level, which is good for health.
